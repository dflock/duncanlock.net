The human body is almost unbelievably efficient - 900 mpg You cannot run off the food you eat - unless you're very careful what you eat.

How far can you run on various foods:

- Banana
- Croissant
- Haribo
- Bacon

Junk food has the Energy density of Dynamite

Everyone has a six-pack - it's just buried

Literally - a six pack is just your abdominal muscles - and everyone has them. If you didn't you wouldn't be able to walk upright, breathe or do much else. If you want the classic six-pack look, you just have to dig them out from under the fat - i.e. get your body fat percentage under 10%.

Then Why Bother with Exercise?

You were born to run; literally - made, shaped, fashioned by time - to run, jump & swim. We're the only animal that walks upright. Our feet used to be ape-hands and our ankles are wrists. Our knees, backs and ankles are terrible design compromises. And yet - we can out run a cheetah over distance and run down deer and horses (welsh horse vs man race) over longer distances. Human beings, with a bit of practice, can run for days without stopping (ultra-runners). We did not get this way by accident. Our ancestors did a *huge* amount of exercise, generation after generation, for millions of years.

Exercise for health - and for Joy, not for weight loss

Find something that you like doing and do that - just for the joy of it - and for the joy of being fit, being strong, being *alive*.

Next time you eat a cake, don't tell yourself you'll burn it off at bootcamp - because you can't, no matter how hard you try. Either don't eat the cake, or stop lying to yourself.
