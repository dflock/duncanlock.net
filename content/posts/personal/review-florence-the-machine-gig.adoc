Just experienced the incredible, joyous, wonderful Florence + the Machine in Vancouver. Amazing. I'm officially part of Miss Haversham's cult now!

I've been a fan for ages; their music just really lifts me up. This is the first time I've seen them live, and they really blew me away - what a great show!

This was their first tour post-covid, so included some emotional tales about how the pandemic affected people who's vocation - and living - comes from performing live music.

== Learnings

Things I learned from this gig:

- Rogers Arena is a pretty good venue, especially if you're on the floor, near the front.
- Make a playlist after each gig with the setlist, so that you can relive the gig. I've been making these on YouTube Music, usually with the setlist from https://www.setlist.fm/ and my memory. I really _love_ these playlists - it's such a simple thing to do, but I've found that it really keeps the hugely uplifting positive feelings I get from live music going all week!
