I really want to do something more worthwhile with my skills. I'm fed up with doing commercial web & software development - which boils down to helping people sell junk slightly better - indirectly helping to destroy the planet and my future - a little bit at a time.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, since going through my first startup experience - the current pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in the IT industry. There must be something better that I could be doing with my life - something that aligns with my beliefs and that uses my skills to make the world a better place - a little bit at a time.

I've long admired the work that people like David McCandless (and the rest of the Guardian Data Blog people), MySociety, TheyWorkForYou, the ODI, the GDS people at gov.uk, the OpenNorth people (opennorth.ca), Transparency International, etc, etc... do - it seems Worthwhile to me.

You can't have real democracy without an informed and engaged electorate - and you can't be informed or engaged without information (and the visualizations to interpret it and the tools to use it). Making the world a more transparent place seems to me a Very Worthwhile thing to do with your life.

The growing power asymmetry between civil society and national governments on one hand and transnational corporations on the other is a defining issue of our time - being at the root of many other issues.

The corporate transparency side of this has recently come to wider attention in the wake of the plethora of tax avoidance and off-shore 'scandals' that have broken in the mainstream media lately. It seems to me that this is probably just the tip of a very large iceberg that the general public are largely unaware of.

I would love to work with OpenCorporates to help make the world a more transparent place.

I currently live in Vancouver but am a British Citizen. I would consider relocating but would prefer to work remotely, if at all possible.
