A spellbinding & breathtaking evening, with a couple of surprising jewels, in a night full of riches.

Just got back from seeing Nick Cave and Warren Ellis in Vancouver. What a joy and a privilege! I've missed live music so much - what an incredible night!

This is a video from that night in Vancouver, of their cover of Cosmic Dancer, which was a fantastic surprise for me. That video was taken by someone standing just in front of me!

We got _two_ encores. The first one was Hollywood, Henry Lee & Girl in Amber - all great. Then they cleared the stage and lots of people left. Then we got a second encore!

This is Into My Arms, which he did with just the amazing backing singers, as a second encore, after half the audience had left thinking it was done - one of several completely spellbinding moments:

== Learnings

Things I learned from this gig:

- This _really_ re-enforced my earlier lessons from the link:++{filename}/posts/personal/review-sigur-ros-world-tour-vancouver-2022.adoc++[Sigur RÃ³s gig] - be at the front & only go see people you would happily sit down and listen to for a solid hour at home.
- If you're enjoying it, stay until the very end; if you can, make sure you don't have to be somewhere afterwards.
