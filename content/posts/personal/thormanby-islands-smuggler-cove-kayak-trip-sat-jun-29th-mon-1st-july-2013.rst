   We started at Welcome Beach on Saturday afternoon, kayaked over to Thormanby for lunch, then up and round to Buccaneer Bay - stunning camp on the dunes, then over to Smugglers Cove on Sunday. Camped there Sunday night, with a trip to Secret Cove in the afternoon, then back to Welcome Beach on Monday morning.

Take the #257 Express Bus from downtown to Horseshoe Bay. We normally get on at the stop on W. Georgia, right outside The Bay. You can also catch the #250 from here - which isn't an express but doesn't take too much longer. $2.50 per person.

Ferry to Langdale. Foot passenger, $15 per person, inc. return.

Catch the (only) bus from Langdale ferry terminal and get off at Sechelt; $2.25 per person.

Welcome Beach to Thormanby
===========================


Pulled up at a tiny deserted beach on the east side of Thormanby, for cider and snacks. Watching the Ospreys hunt in the bay in front of us.

Welcome Passage to Buccaneer Bay

Camping at the Gap

Sunday Morning, having breakfast, watching the Ospreys catching fish in the bay.


Smugglers Cove & Secret Cove
=============================

Walking through the Park, came across a Beaver Dam. Heard three beavers diving in and swimming away, saw the tail end of one of them.

Wetland habitat created by the beavers from the drowned forest valley.
