A travelogue from our Canada Day 2013 long weekend kayak camping trip to Thormanby Islands, Smuggler Cove & Secret Cove, on the sunshine coast.

   We started at Welcome Beach on Saturday afternoon, kayaked over to Thormanby for lunch, then up and round to Buccaneer Bay - stunning camp on the dunes, then over to Smugglers Cove on Sunday. Camped there Sunday night, with a trip to Secret Cove in the afternoon, then back to Welcome Beach on Monday morning.

Welcome Beach to Thormanby
===========================

On Saturday morning, we packed up our tent & got picked up by Erika from Talaysay Tours, who drove us, with the Kayak on the roof, to Welcome Beach, about 15 mins further up Highway 101, past Sechelt.

We unloaded the Kayak, took it down to the surf and loaded all our gear into it, ready to paddle off into the blue.

    Standing on Welcome Beach, looking south-west across Welcome Passage towards the gap between Merry Island on the left & South Thormanby Island on the right.

The first stretch of paddling was about 45 minutes, across the widest part of Welcome Passage. The sea here is very sheltered and calm - and we had stunning weather: hot and sunny, with just enough sea breeze to keep cool. Welcome Passage is quite busy with boat traffic and the water was very murky, full of churned up algae, sea weed and a fair bit of floating lumber. We didn't spot any marine mammals in Welcome Passage the entire weekend - and not much other sea-life either. It's a busy & noisy waterway in the summer (by BC standards) - a huge contrast to the relatively pristine waters of Sechelt Inlet, where Seals, Starfish, Sunstars and Sea Cucumbers abound.

Once we'd made it to the other side, we pulled up at a tiny deserted beach about Â½ way up the east side of South Thormanby Island, for cider and snacks. The water here was a bit clearer - and we watched Ospreys hunt in the bay in front of us while we rested:

Welcome Passage to Buccaneer Bay
=================================

   :class: align-left

After a quick break we paddled off, up the east side of the island, round the top and into Buccaneer Bay. As Welcome Passage narrows the current and swell get slightly stronger - but it was such a calm day it was hardly noticeable. This side of Thormanby is very craggy with step cliffs and deep little bays - topped with characteristically gnarly Arbutus trees.

All along the passage, the high tide line was strongly marked on the cliffs at each side - visible even on the opposite side. This turned out to be a carpet of tiny mussels, almost like fur, clinging to the rocks & completely covering them from the high water mark down.

Once you reach the top of the passage, the big blue expanse of the Georgia Strait opens in front of you, with the sunshine coast on the right and Texada Island in the distance on the left.

The top of South Thormanby ends in a series of craggy fingers of rock, sloping down into the Strait, each with a long deep bay between. Some of these have small houses and private docks in - with, presumably, fabulous views up the coast.

Once you round the corner, the very large sheltered Buccaneer Bay opens up on your left. There were lots of boats moored in and around the islets at the top of the bay, and a few holiday cottages and docks along the shore. These gave way to larger boats as we neared the anchorage at the end of the bay.

Camping at the Gap
===================

We beached the Kayak at the end of the bay, at Buccaneer Bay Provincial park. This is a sand spit that joins North and South Thormanby Islands together - with space for 10 - 15 tents. It has stunning views - if you face one way, you can see up Buccaneer Bay, to the Sunshine Coast, with the Coastal Mountains in the distance - if you turn around, you can see across Georgia Strait to Vancouver Island on the horizon. Welcome to The Gap:

    Standing on the Gap, looking north east, towards the mouth of the bay.

    ...and looking south west, towards Vancouver Island.


You could easily imagine 17th century pirates anchoring their galleons in the bay and drinking rum around campfires on the beach - an effect heightened when this two masted schooner sailed into the bay a few hours after we arrived:

    This beautiful two masted schooner sailed into the bay a few hours after we arrived. As we sat on the beach, reading, propped up on a log, they anchored and the crew rowed ashore in long boats.

We made camp, walked around the beaches, took in the views and had a relaxed dinner. At some point, our neighbours slipped off in one of their kayaks. They returned about an hour later, with the front cockpit full of fish - which they cleaned and gutted in the surf and cooked over a fire. Prior to this, I was quite happy with my stew, but I admit, I was rather envious of their fishing skills.

We were treated to a glorious sunset to round off a pretty perfect day:

Buccaneer Bay to Smugglers Cove
================================

On Sunday morning, we had a lazy breakfast on the beach - and watched an Osprey catch theirs in the bay, right in front of us. We eventually packed the camp back into the kayak and headed out, up the east side of North Thormanby island, to checkout the beaches we saw on the way in.

There are lots more holiday cottages and lots more boats moored on this side of the bay, especially as you approach the long, sandy, Vaucroft Beach. This is a popular day trip spot for boaters, as it's very close to Secret Cove, a fairly large marina.

    There was also a float place moored up just off Vaucroft Beach

Trip to Secret Cove, for Ice Cream

Back to Smugglers Cove
------------------------

Walking through the Park, came across a Beaver Dam. Heard three beavers diving in and swimming away, saw the tail end of one of them.

Paddle back to Welcome Beach, meet Erika, car back to Sechelt, bus to Langdale, etc...

All in all - an amazing weekend. Shower time!

Logistics & Getting there from Vancouver
========================================

We don't own a car - but getting to the sunshine coast is very easy on public transport - and much cheaper than taking a car on the ferry. Here's how we did it:

We took the #257 Express Bus from downtown Vancouver to Horseshoe Bay. We normally get on at the stop on West Georgia St., right outside The Bay. You can also catch the #250 from here - which isn't an express but doesn't take too much longer. This costs $2.75 per person.

Once we got to Horeshoe Bay, we took the ferry to Langdale. These are fairly frequent, but with occasional gaps, so `check the schedule <http://www.bcferries.com/schedules/mainland/vasc-current.php>`_. As a foot passenger, we've never had to wait or not been able to get on - we just walk onto the first ferry that turns up. This is $15 per person, including the return trip. If you're planning to do this often, it's worth getting a `BC Ferries Experience card <https://www.bcferries.com/experience_and_coast_card/>`_. You have to pre-load it with at least $60, but you get ~20% of most fares.

   Bus from Vancouver to Horseshoe Bay, then Ferry to Langdale, followed by bus to Sechelt. Taxi to Porpoise Bay camp site, stay overnight. Lift to Welcome Beach with Kayak people, then off!

The ferry crossing is a *very* scenic 45 min trip across Howe Sound. Once we arrived at Langdale, we followed the other foot passengers out, through the foot passenger tunnel to the car parks, then caught the 'Highway 101' bus - it's the only bus from the only bus stop, so you can't really get this wrong - although there are express and non-express buses, which are quite a bit slower. Anyway, we got off at Sechelt, outside Trail Bay mall (the last stop). This costs $2.25 per person.

Porpoise Bay
------------

We stayed overnight at `Porpoise Bay Provincial Park <http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/porpoise/>`_, just outside Sechelt. This park - and Sechelt Inlet that it's on, is worth a trip on it's own - the Inlet has very nice sheltered Kayaking with lots of quiet, empty camping and loads of wildlife.

To get here, we normally catch a Taxi from Trail Bay mall in Sechelt to the park - it's ~5km out of Sechelt; this costs ~$15, call Sechelt Taxi 604-989-8294 -- and `BC Parks are ~$11 per night, per group <http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/fees/>`_.

For this trip we overnighted here so that we could get a lift to and from Welcome Beach (and rent a Kayak) from `Talaysay Tours, who rent Kayaks from the beach at Porpoise Bay <http://www.talaysay.com/>`_, among other locations. They have good equipment and are extremely friendly & helpful.
