A travelogue from our Canada Day 2013 long weekend kayak camping trip to Thormanby Islands, Smuggler Cove & Secret Cove, on the sunshine coast.

   We started at Welcome Beach on Saturday afternoon, kayaked over to Thormanby for lunch, then up and round to Buccaneer Bay - stunning camp on the dunes, then over to Smugglers Cove on Sunday. Camped there Sunday night, with a trip to Secret Cove in the afternoon, then back to Welcome Beach on Monday morning.

Welcome Beach to Thormanby
===========================

On Saturday morning, we packed up our tent & got picked up by Erika from Talaysay Tours, who drove us, with the Kayak on the roof, to Welcome Beach, about 15 mins further up Highway 101, past Sechelt.

We unloaded the Kayak, took it down to the surf and loaded all our gear into it, ready to paddle off into the blue.

    Standing on Welcome Beach, looking south-west across Welcome Passage towards the gap between Merry Island on the left & South Thormanby Island on the right.

The first stretch of paddling was about 45 minutes, across the widest part of Welcome Passage. The sea here is very sheltered and calm - and we had stunning weather: hot and sunny, with just enough sea breeze to keep cool. Welcome Passage is quite busy with boat traffic and the water was very murky, full of churned up algae, sea weed and a fair bit of floating lumber. We didn't spot any marine mammals in Welcome Passage the entire weekend - and not much other sea-life either. It's a very busy and noisy waterway (by BC standards) - a huge contrast to the relatively pristine waters of Sechelt Inlet, where Seals, Starfish, Sunstars and Sea Cucumbers abound.

Once we'd made it to the other side, we pulled up at a tiny deserted beach about  on the east side of Thormanby, for cider and snacks. The water here was a bit clearer - we watched the Ospreys hunt in the bay in front of us while we rested:

Welcome Passage to Buccaneer Bay
=================================


Camping at the Gap
===================

Sunday Morning, having breakfast, watching the Ospreys catching fish in the bay.


Smugglers Cove & Secret Cove
=============================

Walking through the Park, came across a Beaver Dam. Heard three beavers diving in and swimming away, saw the tail end of one of them.

Shower time!

Getting there from Vancouver
============================

We don't own a car - but getting to the sunshine coast is very easy on public transport - and much cheaper than taking a car on the ferry. Here's how we did it:

We took the #257 Express Bus from downtown Vancouver to Horseshoe Bay. We normally get on at the stop on West Georgia St., right outside The Bay. You can also catch the #250 from here - which isn't an express but doesn't take too much longer. This costs $2.75 per person.

Once we got to Horeshoe Bay, we took the ferry to Langdale. These are fairly frequent, but with occasional gaps, so `check the schedule <http://www.bcferries.com/schedules/mainland/vasc-current.php>`_. As a foot passenger, we've never had to wait or not been able to get on - we just walk onto the first ferry that turns up. This is $15 per person, including the return trip. If you're planning to do this often, it's worth getting a `BC Ferries Experience card <https://www.bcferries.com/experience_and_coast_card/>`_. You have to pre-load it with at least $60, but you get ~20% of most fares.

   Bus from Vancouver to Horseshoe Bay, then Ferry to Langdale, followed by bus to Sechelt. Taxi to Porpoise Bay camp site, stay overnight. Lift to Welcome Beach with Kayak people, then off!

The ferry crossing is a *very* scenic 45 min trip across Howe Sound. Once we arrived at Langdale, we followed the other foot passengers out, through the foot passenger tunnel to the car parks, then caught the 'Highway 101' bus - it's the only bus from the only bus stop, so you can't really get this wrong - although there are express and non-express buses, which are quite a bit slower. Anyway, we got off at Sechelt, outside Trail Bay mall (the last stop). This costs $2.25 per person.

Porpoise Bay
------------

We stayed overnight at `Porpoise Bay Provincial Park <http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/porpoise/>`_, just outside Sechelt. This park - and Sechelt Inlet that it's on, is worth a trip on it's own - the Inlet has very nice sheltered Kayaking with lots of quiet, empty camping and loads of wildlife.

To get here, we normally catch a Taxi from Trail Bay mall in Sechelt to the park - it's ~5km out of Sechelt; this costs ~$15 -- and BC Parks are $11 per night, per group.

For this trip we overnighted here so that we could get a lift to Welcome Beach (and rent a Kayak) from `Talaysay Tours, who rent Kayaks from the beach at Porpoise Bay <http://www.talaysay.com/>`_, among other locations. They have good equipment and are extremely friendly & helpful.
