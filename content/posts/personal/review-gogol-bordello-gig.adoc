== Learnings

Things I learned from this gig:

- I'm not a fan of mosh pits - at least, not anymore.
- The merchandise table used to be on your left as you came in, but this now sells horrifically overpriced snacks & water. I finally noticed that the new merch stand is over on your right as you come in, past the bar, up in the corner,
