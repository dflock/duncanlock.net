I've been fermenting vegetables of various kinds (and occasionally other things) at home for a little over two years. It's a fun, interesting & nutritious hobby. On the whole it's pretty easy and low stakes -- the worst thing that happens is a few cucumbers go mouldy.

If you want to try, here's how I'd recommend that you get started.


== Books for Getting Started

I've read these books and would recommend them. To get started, I got the first one, Wild Fermentation, and went from there:

* https://amzn.to/3vsrC3H[Wild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foods, 2nd Edition]
* https://amzn.to/3xtPMfy[The Noma Guide to Fermentation]
* https://amzn.to/3gvjhb2[Fiery Ferments: 70 Stimulating Recipes for Hot Sauces, Spicy Chutneys, Kimchis with Kick, and Other Blazing Fermented Condiments]
