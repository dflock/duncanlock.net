A beautiful - and beautifully executed game. The controls are perfect - precise yet perfectly balanced; possibly the best jump in any platform game ever. But it's so much more. Minimal in appearance, yet rich in humour, characterisation and depth. Who knew that rectangles could have such complex emotional relationships? Graphics, timing, narration, progression are all deftly done, with polish and perfect timing. And the soundtrack - even if you never play the game (which would be a huge mistake) it's worth buying for the soundtrack alone.

 I really don't say this very often, but it almost makes you proud to be British.
