How to find questions you can answer
======================================

Use the `no answers <http://stackoverflow.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers>`_ page, but make sure you add *lots* of Ignored Tags. Anytime you see a question that you don't know anything about, add it's tags to your Ignored Tags list. This fades questions with these tags, making it much easier to skim through the list finding things that you *can* answer.

Don't be afraid to add lots of ignored tags - it's not an admission of failure - there will always be lots of things that you aren't an expert on.

Add some favourite tags too - this highlights questions with these tags, again, helping you to sort the wheat from the chaff.


Mercenary Reputation Building 101
======================================

Answers in the comments are just asking for it
--------------------------------------------------

For some reason, people often answer questions in the comments - this is wrong for lots of reasons:

- It makes the answers hard to find for other people & adds to the noise on the site.
- It means that an answer can never be accepted, so other people won't be able to tell it has and answer - and the question will appear in the Unanswered lists forever.
- You get no credit for answers supplied in the comments
- Formatting and space is very limited.
- etc...

If people are stupid enough to do this, then they deserve to be punished (a little tiny bit). Copy their answer out of the comment into a real answer. Expand on it in the extra space you now have, improve the formatting - and wait for the reputation points to roll in.

Answer questions from experienced users
-------------------------------------------
Everything else being equal, answer questions asked by users with higher reputation. They know how the site works, they know to accept and up-vote answers. New users often don't, or they'll ask a question and never some back - so it's much more likely that you'll answer their questions and not get any reward for it.

Answer lots of questions
-------------------------------
This seems obvious, but the more questions you answer, the more reputation you'll gain. Good answers keep building reputation over time as new people discover them and up-vote them - and the more of your answers are out there, the more rep. you'll gain from this on an ongoing basis.

Preferentially answer questions with bounties
------------------------------------------------
Again, obvious - questions with bounties give you the bounty as reputation if you post the accepted (or highest voted) answer. Use the `Featured list <http://stackoverflow.com/questions?pagesize=50&sort=featured>`_ to see all questions with Bounties.

Getting Badges
--------------
Preferentially answering older, unanswered questions is a good way to get `Necromancer <http://stackoverflow.com/badges/17/necromancer?userid=259698>`_, `Revival <http://stackoverflow.com/badges/837/revival?userid=259698>`_ and `Excavator <http://stackoverflow.com/badges/1287/excavator?userid=259698>`_ badges.
