I've recently been corresponding with `Denny Dias <http://mexapi.macpress.com.br/>`_, from Brazil, who's `converted his blog over to Pelican <http://mexapi.macpress.com.br/2013/08/migrei-meu-blog-do-insosso-blogger-para-a-poderosa-dupla.html>`_ - and we've been helping each other out a bit with building themes and whatnot.

He's written up his conversion & theme building process - and was `generous enough to credit me <http://mexapi.macpress.com.br/2013/09/migrei-meu-blog-customizando-o-tema.html>`_ after he borrowed some of my theme's logic, from this blog's `GitHub repo <https://github.com/dflock/duncanlock.net>`_.

As he's such a nice guy - and as I've just borrowed his ``tagsort`` jinja filter for my `blog's tag page </tags.html>`_, I though I'd return the favour - cheers Deny! :)
