:meta_description: How to use an existing instance of a browser to debug in VSCode - instead of always launching a new one, or use debug in Brave.

If you want to use an existing instance of a browser to debug in VSCode - instead of always launching a new one - you have to:

* Change the shortcut that you use to start the browser, to add `--remote-debugging-port=9222` on the end of the command line, so that it always runs in "debug ready" mode.
* Use a wildcard for the `url` in your `launch.js` config file.

To debug web apps in VSCode with https://brave.com/[Brave] - add this to your `launch.js`:

[source,json]
