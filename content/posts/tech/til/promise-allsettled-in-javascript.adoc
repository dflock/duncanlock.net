:meta_description: Sometimes I want to resolve several promises at once, then do something when they're all done. For example, make several API calls, then do something with all the results. Promise.allSettled is a better way to do this.

Sometimes I want to resolve several promises at once, then do something when they're all done. For example, make several API calls, then do something with all the results.::PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

I was doing something like this before:

[source,js]
----
// Build your promises array
let promises = [
  fetch('https://blah.com/static/file.json'),
  fetch('https://blah.com/api/thing/one'),
  fetch('https://blah.com/apr/thing/two'),
]

Promise.all(promises.map((p) => p.catch((err) => err)))
  .then(([file, thing1, thing2]) => {
      console.log(file)
      console.log(thing1)
      console.log(thing2)
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error({ err })
    })
----

A simpler, neater & easier to read version uses `Promise.allSettled(promises)` to do the same thing:

[source,js]
----
// Build your promises array
let promises = [
  fetch('https://blah.com/static/file.json'),
  fetch('https://blah.com/api/thing/one'),
  fetch('https://blah.com/apr/thing/two'),
]

// Resolve all the promises
Promise.allSettled(promises)
  .then(([file, thing1, thing2]) => {
    // Each promise in the original array is now a response object:
    // For each outcome object, a status string is present. If the status is fulfilled, then a value is present.
    // If the status is rejected, then a reason is present.
    // The value (or reason) reflects what value each promise was fulfilled (or rejected) with.
    console.log(file)
    console.log(thing1)
    console.log(thing2)
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error({ err })
  })
