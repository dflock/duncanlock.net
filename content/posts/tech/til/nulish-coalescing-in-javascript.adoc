My new favourite thing in JS is Nullish coalescing:

The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is `null` or `undefined`, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.

[source,js]
----
return this.thing1 ?? this.thing2 ?? 'default'
----

Also works well with the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining[Optional Chaining Operator], which is also great - not more "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'thing1' of undefined":

[source,js]
----
return this?.things.?.thing1 ?? this?.things?.['thing2'] ?? 'default'
----

This is like logical or - `||` - but instead of testing for `truthy` & `falsy`, it tests for `nullish` - which is often what you want.

Nullish all the things!
