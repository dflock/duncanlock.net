:meta_description: The Python Black formatter outputs to stderr, not stdout

Which is fine - it's reporting errors, after all.
So, if you want to capture the output to a file in Linux/Bash, you need to do it like this:

[source,console]
----
$ black --check . 2> black-report.txt
----

or like this to _also_ output to the console, so you can see it:

[source,console]
----
$ black --check . 2> >(tee -a black-report.txt >&2)
----

Bash has a shortcut for this, but you lose the return code from black:

[source,console]
----
$ black --check . |& tee black-report.txt
----
