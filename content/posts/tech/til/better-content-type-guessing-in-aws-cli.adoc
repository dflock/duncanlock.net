The content-type guessing done by AWS CLI is based on the mimetype definitions available on your system. You can improve the mimetype guessing by updating these definitions.

It uses the python `mimetypes` lib https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/cedc9b74202d8c1ae39bca261cbb45d42ed54d45/Lib/mimetypes.py#L42-L52[to do this and checks the following files]:

[source,python]
----
knownfiles = [
    "/etc/mime.types",
    "/etc/httpd/mime.types",                    # Mac OS X
    "/etc/httpd/conf/mime.types",               # Apache
    "/etc/apache/mime.types",                   # Apache 1
    "/etc/apache2/mime.types",                  # Apache 2
    "/usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/mime.types",
    "/usr/local/lib/netscape/mime.types",
    "/usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/mime.types",     # Apache 1.2
    "/usr/local/etc/mime.types",                # Apache 1.3
    ]
----

I would suggest leaving `/etc/mime.types` (and any of the other files in this list that already exist on your system) alone. I would create one of the files that you don't have -- something like this:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apache2
$ curl -s "http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types?view=co" | sudo tee /etc/apache2/mime.types
----

This downloads the latest mimetypes definitions from the Apache project and saves it as `/etc/apache2/mime.types`. I don't have the Apache web server installed on this system, so it wasn't there before.
