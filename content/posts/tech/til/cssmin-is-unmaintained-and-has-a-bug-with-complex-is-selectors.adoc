:meta_description: cssmin is unmaintained & has a bug with complex :is selectors

I was using `cssmin` to compress the CSS on this site during publishing. This has been working fine since April 2013, when I created this new iteration of the site using https://blog.getpelican.com/[Pelican]. Unbeknownst to me, cssmin has been unmaintained since October 2013. This didn't cause any problems until recently, when I revamped the CSS and started using the new-ish link:++{filename}the-css-is-selector-is-pretty-neat.adoc++[:is selector].

So a selector like this:

[source,css]
----
.content :is(figure, img) :is(.align-left, .align-right)
----

would get the spaces removed and get output like this, breaking it:

[source,css]
----
.content:is(figure, img):is(.align-left, .align-right)
----

My solution was to change to `rcssmin`, literally a one character change to the https://pypi.org/project/pelican-webassets/[webassets] call:

[source,jinja]
----
{% assets filters="rcssmin", output="css/style.min.css", ...
----

and then just update the python modules in the venv:

[source,console]
----
$ python -m pip uninstall cssmin
$ python -m pip install rcssmin
----
