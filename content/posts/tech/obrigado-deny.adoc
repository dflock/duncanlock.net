I've recently been corresponding with http://mexapi.macpress.com.br/[Denny Dias], from Brazil, who's http://mexapi.macpress.com.br/2013/08/migrei-meu-blog-do-insosso-blogger-para-a-poderosa-dupla.html[converted his blog over to Pelican] - and we've been helping each other out a bit with building themes and whatnot.

He's written up his conversion & theme building process - and was http://mexapi.macpress.com.br/2013/09/migrei-meu-blog-customizando-o-tema.html[generous enough to credit me] after he borrowed some of my theme's logic, from this blog's https://github.com/dflock/duncanlock.net[GitHub repo].

As he's such a nice guy - and as I've just borrowed his `tagsort` jinja filter for my link:/tags.html[blog's tag page], I though I'd return the favour - cheers Deny! :)
