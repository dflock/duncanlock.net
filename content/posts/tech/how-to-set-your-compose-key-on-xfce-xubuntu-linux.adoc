:meta_description: The compose key on Linux is _incredibly_ useful, but not set by default - and on XFCE there's currently no GUI to change it. Here's how to do it...

.Just hold down your chosen compose key, then press the other keys in turn: [compose key] + e + = gets you a Euro symbol.

The compose key on Linux is _incredibly_ useful, but not configured by default - and on XFCE there's currently no graphical UI to change it. However, it's pretty simple to change... here's how to make the Caps Lock key your compose key:

In the file `/etc/default/keyboard`, change `XKBOPTIONS` to look like this:

[source,ini]
----
XKBOPTIONS="compose:caps"
----

Save the file. You can now either reboot, restart X, or see xref:_activating_your_change_without_rebooting[Activating your change without rebooting], below.

If you don't want to use Caps Lock as your compose key, there are some other options to choose from in this file: `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst` - search for 'compose', they're listed towards the end. Mine currently looks like this:

[cols="41%,59%",options="header"]
|===
|Setting|Compose Key
|compose:ralt|Right Alt
|compose:lwin|Left Win
|compose:rwin|Right Win
|compose:menu|Menu
|compose:lctrl|Left Ctrl
|compose:rctrl|Right Ctrl
|compose:caps|Caps Lock
|compose:102|&lt;Less/Greater&gt;
|compose:paus|Pause
|compose:prsc|PrtSc
|compose:sclk|Scroll Lock
|===

== Using the Compose Key

Try holding down the Caps Lock key and type the letter `l`, followed by a dash you should get a British Pound symbol: £ - magic!

Generally you can just hold down your compose key then type a combo that kinda 'looks like' the symbol you want, if they were drawn on top of each other. For example, `e` followed by `=` will get you a Euro symbol: €, `o` followed by `c` will get you a copyright symbol: © - and `1` followed by `2` gets you a half fraction: ½.

These work anywhere you can type things. There's a list of some common ones http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key#Common_compose_combinations[here], and a http://www.hermit.org/Linux/ComposeKeys.html[full list here].

== Activating your change without rebooting

=== Option One

Once you've changed your permanent setup by changing `/etc/default/keyboard`, you can set your current session using `setxkbmap`, like this:

[source,console]
----
$ setxkbmap -option compose:caps
----

It uses the same names for keys as above. It's also possible to leave `/etc/default/keyboard` alone and add this command to your `~/.xinit`, `~/.xsession` or the XFCE autostart commands instead. If you do that, it'll only apply to your login, not system wide though.

=== Option Two

This was the first method that I discovered and isn't a simple as Option One, but if that doesn't work for some reason, this should. Like it says at the top of `/etc/default/keyboard`, check `/usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/README.Debian` for what to do after you've modified it. Mine currently says:

[quote]
____
After modifying `/etc/default/keyboard`, you can apply the changes to the Linux
console by running `setupcon`. If X is configured to use that file too, then the
changes will become visible to X only if

`udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change`

is called, or the system is rebooted.
____

When it says Console, it means it -- not a terminal window, an actual login console -- try pressing `Ctrl + Alt + F1` and logging in, then running:

[source,console]
----
$ setupcon
$ udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change
----

These don't print anything out when they run, disconcertingly. Once you've run them in the Console, `Ctrl + Alt + F7` should get you back to the default console session you were in before.
