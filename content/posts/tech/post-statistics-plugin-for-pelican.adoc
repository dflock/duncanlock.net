:meta_description: A Pelican plugin to calculate various statistics about a post and store them in an `+article.stats+` dictionary. Includes time to read, word count, word frequency and Flesch-kincaid stats.

This is a Pelican plugin to calculate various statistics about a post and store them in an `+article.stats+` dictionary. You can see this in action in the sidebar on the left of this site.

I wanted to implement the nice little "X min read" thing from https://medium.com/[Medium] - and it turned out that it was easy to provide a few other interesting stats at the same time, for people to use in their templates.

The returned `+article.stats+` dictionary contains the following:

* `+wc+`: how many words
* `+read_mins+`: how many minutes would it take to read this article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute#Reading_and_comprehension[based on 250 wpm]
* `+word_counts+`: frequency count of all the words in the article; can be used for tag/word clouds
* `+fi+`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests[Flesch-kincaid] Index/ Reading Ease
* `+fk+`: Flesch-kincaid Grade Level

For example:

[source,python]
----
{
    'wc': 2760,
    'fi': '65.94',
    'fk': '7.65',
    'word_counts': Counter({u'to': 98, u'a': 90, ...}),
    'read_mins': 12
}
----

This allows you to output these values in your templates, like this, for example:

[source,html+jinja]
----
<p title="~{{ article.stats['wc'] }} words">~{{ article.stats['read_mins'] }} min read</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flesch-kincaid Index/ Reading Ease: {{ article.stats['fi'] }}</li>
    <li>Flesch-kincaid Grade Level: {{ article.stats['fk'] }}</li>
</ul>
----

The `+word_counts+` variable is a python `+Counter+` dictionary and looks something like this, with each unique word and it's frequency:

[source,python]
----
Counter({u'to': 98, u'a': 90, u'the': 83, u'of': 50, u'karma': 50, .....
----

This can be used to create a tag/word cloud for a post.

== Requirements

`+post_stats+` requires http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/[BeautifulSoup]:

[source,console]
----
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
----

== Caveat Emptor

Please note that the values are a wee bit approximate - it's surprisingly difficult to compute a _perfect_ word count - it depends on what you count as a 'word', how many code samples, data tables, etc... you have in your post. Calculating the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests[Flesch-kincaid Index/ Reading Ease/ Grade level] stuff involves counting syllables - again something that is very hard to do perfectly, but quite easy to get 90% right.

In addition, the Flesch-kincaid stuff currently only works on English text, but everything else should work multi-language. I haven't done much Unicode testing though, so https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins[patches welcome]!
