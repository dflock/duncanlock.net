:meta_description: A few of the changes in Pelican 3.3 might mean making some changes to your site in order to upgrade. Here's how I upgraded my site from Pelican 3.2 to 3.3.

There are https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues?milestone=5&state=closed[quite a few changes] in http://blog.getpelican.com/pelican-3.3-released.html[Pelican 3.3] - most of them minor, but a few which might mean making some changes to your site in order to upgrade. This is what I did to move my site from Pelican 3.2 to 3.3.

The change that had the biggest impact and took the most work was around image linking - caused by a combination of things. I think I was doing it wrong before and things changed in a way that meant this no longer worked. I also had to update my link:++{filename}/posts/tech/better-figures-and-images-plugin-for-pelican.adoc++[Better Figures & Images plugin] to take this into account.

Previously, I'd been linking to my images like this, both in my theme:

[source,css]
----
/* Theme CSS Image Link */
background: #2C71B8 url(/static/images/blueprint-background.png) repeat;
----

[source,jinja]
----
{# Theme HTML/Jinja image link #}
<meta name="twitter:image" content="{{ SITEURL }}/static/images/favicon-128x128.png">
----

and in my content:

[source,rst]
----
.. image:: /static/images/dunc_smiling_192x192.jpg

.. figure:: /static/images/pages/404-error.png
----

This is linking to the output location of the final images, in the `/output/static/images` folder. I don't think this is the way you're supposed to do it - and it doesn't appear to work with Pelican 3.3.

The way you're supposed to do it, I think, is to use a place-holder for the first bit of the path and, effectively, link to the source location of the file, not the destination. The http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html#linking-to-internal-content[relevant documentation is here] - and the above examples now look like this:

[source,css]
----
/* Theme CSS Image Link - not processed, so no place-holder */
background: #2C71B8 url(/images/blueprint-background.png) repeat;
----

[source,jinja]
----
{# Theme HTML/Jinja image link - not processed, so no place-holder #}
<meta name="twitter:image" content="{{ SITEURL }}/images/favicon-128x128.png">
----

[source,rst]
----
.. image:: {static}/images/dunc_smiling_192x192.jpg

.. figure:: {static}/images/pages/404-error.png
----

== Theme Changes

The theme changes were the same: I removed the `/static` from the start of any image links. Because the theme files aren't content, they don't get processed by Pelican, so you don't use the `{static}` place-holder here. All the changes looked something like this:

[source,diff]
----
- <meta name="twitter:image" content="{{ SITEURL }}/static/images/test.png">
+ <meta name="twitter:image" content="{{ SITEURL }}/images/test.png">
----

You can see the Git commit with all the theme changes https://github.com/dflock/blueprint/commit/bae678828b4535fcece8327c0f2dbae63bf4c92f[here], https://github.com/dflock/blueprint[in the Blueprint Theme Repository].

== Content Changes

[quote]
____
The syntax for linking to source content has been changed in order to ensure compatibility with Markdown and reST extensions. For example, the new syntax for Markdown: `[a link relative to content root]({static}/article1.md)`
The previous `|filename|/article1.md` syntax will continue to be supported for backwards compatibility.

Again, this is the related to image linking - and is the same change as above. This:

[source,rst]
----
.. image:: /static/images/dunc_smiling_192x192.jpg

.. figure:: /static/images/pages/404-error.png
    :target: /static/images/pages/404-error.png
----

becomes this:

[source,rst]
----
.. image:: {static}/images/dunc_smiling_192x192.jpg

.. figure:: {static}/images/pages/404-error.png
    :target: {static}/images/pages/404-error.png
----

You need to do this in every post that has images. Fortunately this was simple to search & replace. On some posts I also have an extra piece of metadata called `thumbnail`, that also needed updating. This isn't processed by Pelican, so no place-holder here:

[source,diff]
----
-:thumbnail: /static/images/posts/post-name/image.jpg
+:thumbnail: /images/posts/post-name/image.jpg
----

== Configuration Changes

Since the `FILES_TO_COPY` setting has been deprecated, you should replace it with the `STATIC_PATHS` and `EXTRA_PATH_METADATA` http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/settings.html#basic-settings[settings]. The relevant part of my settings file changed like this:

[source,diff]
----
 # static paths will be copied under the same name
-STATIC_PATHS = ["images"]
+STATIC_PATHS = [
+    'images',
+    'extras'
+]

 # A list of extra files to copy from the source to the destination
-FILES_TO_COPY = (
-    ('extras/.htaccess', '.htaccess'),
-    ('extras/robots.txt', 'robots.txt'),
-    ('extras/favicon.ico', 'favicon.ico'),
-)
+EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
+    'extras/.htaccess': {'path': '.htaccess'},
+    'extras/robots.txt': {'path': 'robots.txt'},
+    'extras/favicon.ico': {'path': 'favicon.ico'},
+}
----

You can see the Git commit with all the https://github.com/dflock/duncanlock.net/commit/bcee8b830d45daad00ea9428a339459689a27cf5[content & configuration changes here], in the https://github.com/dflock/duncanlock.net[site repository].

== Plugin Changes

A special case for me is the {static}/posts/tech/better-figures-and-images-plugin-for-pelican.adoc[Better Figures & Images plugin]. I use this plugin and I also wrote it - and it stopped working.

In order to debug it, I first added in some logging support. I added this at the top with the other imports:

[source,python]
----
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
----

and then some of this further down to output the paths that the plugin was seeing:

[source,python]
----
logger.debug('Better Fig. PATH: %s', instance.settings['PATH'])
logger.debug('Better Fig. img.src: %s', img['src'])
----

This made it easier to figure out what I needed to change. The path handling code in the plugin was never very good, so I changed it from this mess:

[source,python]
----
# TODO: Pretty sure this isn't the right way to do this, too hard coded.
# There must be a setting that I should be using?
src = instance.settings['PATH'] + '/images/' + os.path.split(img['src'])[1]

#src = instance.settings['PATH'] + '/images/' + os.path.split(img['src'])[1]

# The method mentioned above is only working if the images are really in the "images" folder.
# It's also not working on subdirectories inside the image folder
# Both issues are fixed:
# Changed the static "/images/" string to the proper path which is extracted from the 'split' tuple
# The first 7 letters are cutted ("/static") to get a valid link.
# Somehow the static folder isn't created in the output folder. It's only on the server after 'make ftp_upload'
src = instance.settings['PATH'] + os.path.split(img['src'])[0][7:] + '/' + os.path.split(img['src'])[1]
----

to this slightly more robust mess:

[source,python]
----
logger.debug('Better Fig. PATH: %s', instance.settings['PATH'])
logger.debug('Better Fig. img.src: %s', img['src'])

img_path, img_filename = path.split(img['src'])

logger.debug('Better Fig. img_path: %s', img_path)
logger.debug('Better Fig. img_fname: %s', img_filename)

# Strip off {static}, |filename| or /static
if img_path.startswith(('{static}', '|filename|')):
    img_path = img_path[10:]
elif img_path.startswith('/static'):
    img_path = img_path[7:]
else:
    logger.warning('Better Fig. Error: img_path should start with either {static}, |filename| or /static')

# Build the source image filename
src = instance.settings['PATH'] + img_path + '/' + img_filename

logger.debug('Better Fig. src: %s', src)
if not (path.isfile(src) and access(src, R_OK)):
    logger.error('Better Fig. Error: image not found: {}'.format(src))
----

This code basically strips the leading `{static}`, `|filename|` or `/static` from the image path, then looks for the original source image inside the current content folder (as set by the `PATH` setting in your config). This new code also contains lots more logging for debugging and reporting any errors or warnings.
