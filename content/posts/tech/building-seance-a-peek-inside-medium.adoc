== Interesting things I found

* There's a fair bit of 'Testing, 1, 2, 3' type posts, especially early on
* Author names aren't trimmed, so they can have leading and trailing white-space and embedded newlines in them.
* None of the early articles have categories - I think this feature was added later.
* There's a really long warm up period - almost a year, until May 2013 when things really take off.
