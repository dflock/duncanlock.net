:meta_description: I wrote a little script that asks Miniflux for a list of my feeds in OPML format and turns it into an AsciiDoc page

I run a https://miniflux.app/[Miniflux] instance on my desktop computer, which fetches all my feeds and makes the content available locally.

Inspired by a https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33585201[discussion the other day on HackerNews], I wrote a little script that asks Miniflux for a list of my feeds in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML[OPML] format and turns it into an AsciiDoc page, which I publish on here, as link:++{filename}/pages/blogroll-links.adoc++[my BlogRoll & Links page]:

[source,python]
----
include::../../../opml2adoc.py[]
----

This outputs to stdout and expects to be run like this:

[source,console]
----
$ python ./opml2adoc.py > content/pages/blogroll-links.adoc
----
