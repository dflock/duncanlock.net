:meta_description: Here's how to add useful custom actions to Thunar's right click menu - and a collection of handy actions to get you started.

Thunar - XFCE & XUbuntu's small but perfectly formed file manager - has a simple mechanism that allows you to easily add new commands to the right click menu of files and folders. These are called `Custom Actions <http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/custom-actions>`_ and are easy to create... here's how to do it.

Click the **Edit** menu, then click '**Configure custom actions...**'. This will take you to the Custom Actions Manager, where you can create, edit or delete your custom actions.

You can enter anything into the command box, including complex bash scripts, names of scripts or executables on the PATH, or the full path and filename of the command you want to run.

On the '**Appearance Conditions**' tab, you tell Thunar when you want your item to appear in the right click menu:

.. figure:: {filename}/images/posts/useful-thunar-custom-actions/thunar-custom-actions-edit-3.png
    :align: right

    Now, when I right click on a text file, I have extra options in my menu.

I've included my custom actions below - and you can find `more around the web <https://www.google.ca/search?q=thunar+custom+actions>`_. I've only included ones here that aren't commonly listed elsewhere.

Working Directory
-------------------

The current working directory for the command run as part of a custom action is the folder the Thunar window that launched it is currently displaying. You can test this by creating and running the following custom action:

Test CWD
============

Description:
    Prints out the current working directory
Command:
    .. code-block:: bash

        pwd | zenity --text-info

File Pattern:
    ``*``
Appears if selection contains:
    Directories
Requirements:
    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt-get install zenity

This means that you can use just filenames without a path in your custom actions to refer to a file in the current folder. This means that you can use the ``%N`` variable to process a list of selected files, instead if having to use the ``%F`` variable which includes the full pathname - this is handy for renaming just the files, without tampering with the pathname, for example.
