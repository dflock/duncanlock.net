Thunar - XFCE & XUbuntu's small but perfectly formed file manager - has a simple mechanism that allows you to easily add new commands to the right click menu of files and folders. These are called http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/custom-actions[Custom Actions] and are easy to create... here's how to do it.

Click the *Edit* menu, then click '*Configure custom actions...*'. This will take you to the Custom Actions Manager, where you can create, edit or delete your custom actions.

You can enter anything into the command box, including complex bash scripts, names of scripts or executables on the PATH, or the full path and filename of the command you want to run.

On the '*Appearance Conditions*' tab, you tell Thunar when you want your item to appear in the right click menu:

.Now, when I right click on a text file, I have extra options in my menu.

I've included my custom actions <<_my_thunar_custom_actions,below>> - and you can find https://www.google.com/search?q=thunar+custom+actions[more around the web]. I've only included ones here that aren't commonly listed elsewhere.

== But first, a word about Working Directories & Variables

=== Working Directory

The current working directory for the a custom action, is the folder the Thunar window that launched the action, is currently displaying. You can test this by creating and running the following custom action:

==== Test CWD

Description::: 

Prints out the current working directory

Command::: 

[source,bash]
----
pwd | zenity --text-info
----

File Pattern::: 

`*`

Appears if selection contains::: 

Directories

Requirements::: 

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install zenity
----



This means that you can use just filenames without a path in your custom actions to refer to a file in the current folder. This means that you can use the `%N` variable to process a list of selected files, instead if having to use the `%F` variable which includes the full pathname - this is handy for renaming just the files, without tampering with the pathname, for example.

=== Variables

Thunar custom actions can contain variable parameters, that get substituted with the actual value when you run the action. These allow you to refer to the files that are currently selected in Thunar when running your actions, without knowing in advance which ones. The following variables are available:

[cols="15%,85%",options="header"]
|===
|This...|is replaced at runtime with this...
|%f|The path to the first selected file
|%F|The paths to all the selected files
|%d|Directory containing the file referred to by %f
|%D|Directories containing the files referred to by %F
|%n|The first selected filename, without the path
|%N|All the selected filenames, without paths
|===

You can see examples of these variables in use below.
