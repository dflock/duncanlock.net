I wanted to add dark mode support to the default nginx "Welcome to nginx" page. This is about the simplest change I could choose to make - it's a simple, backwards compatible, small additive change to one single `index.html` file. My _initial_ version of this change looks like this, and is added to the files `<style>` element, in the `<head>` section:

[source,css]
----
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: #363839;
    color: #d1cec9;
  }
  a {
    color: #c4c4ff;
  }
}
----

So, this is the process of getting that change from my brain, into the upstream nginx codebase. ::PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

== Checking out the Code & Making the Change

The nginx project uses https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/QuickStart[Mercurial], rather than git for source code control. So you will need Mercurial installed for this. This page has https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Download[download links & installation info]. If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, you can just run this to install it:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install mercurial
// Once that's done, check to make sure
$ hg --version
Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 5.3.1)
...
----

Once Mercurial is installed, you can check out the source and make the change like this:

[source,console]
----
// Go to the folder where you want to check out the nginx source
$ cd ~/dev
// Use Mercurial to clone the nginx repo
$ hg clone http://hg.nginx.org/nginx
// Go into the folder
$ cd nginx
// Find the file you need to edit
$ grep -r 'Welcome' .
./docs/html/index.html:<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
./docs/html/index.html:<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
// Make the change
$ $EDITOR ./docs/html/index.html
----

To test this change, you can just open the `~/dev/nginx/docs/html/index.html` in a browser using "File -> Open", as it's just static HTML.

== Contributing the Change Upstream

Nginx development is mailing list based, rather than Github/lab/forge/etc... based. The basic plan is to:

. Join the mailing list
. Send an email to the list, containing a patch with the change.

Follow https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel[the instructions here to join the mailing list]. You will receive a confirmation email. Once you've done that, you can send an email to the list with your change in.

To get your change in a format that's ready to email, I did this:

[source,console]
----
// Commit the change and write a changelog
$ hg commit
// Export the change as a patch, ready to email
$ hg export tip
----

This is the output of that, which I copied & pasted into an email -- and sent it to mailto:nginx-devel@nginx.org[]:

Add support for dark color scheme in default index.html page

Add a little CSS to index.html to support dark color schemes.
This will display the index page in dark colors if the user has
requested a dark color scheme in their system UI or browser, and
display the same as the previous version if not.

See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme

== Back & Forth on the Mailing List

This is https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2021-August/014217.html[my thread on the mailing lists web archive], showing the back & forth discussion which ensued after my initial email.

First Maxim Dounin, one of the nginx core developers, politely said no thanks:

[quote, Maxim Dounin, https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2021-August/014218.html]
____
Thank you for the patch.  I don't think this is something we want 
to customize in the example pages such as index.html, especially 
given that we don't set other colors.
____

My heart sank... but after a while I came back and read it again... "especially given that we don't set other colors.". I guess I shouldn't have hardcoded those dark colors in my change -- that's fair enough. I then started looking to see if there was a way to tell the browser to just use its own built-in stylesheet for the dark-mode colors, just like it does for the regular, light-mode version.

A little while later, Steffan Weber replied with the answer:

[quote, Steffan Weber, https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2021-August/014220.html]
____
You could add the following line which makes modern browsers use colors
from their built-in dark color scheme:

<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">

https://web.dev/color-scheme/
____

So, https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2021-August/014221.html[I said I'd submit a new updated patch in the morning].

== Second Try

So, next morning I did some research & testing, then reset my repository to have another go:

[source,console]
----
$ hg strip tip
----

I then https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2021-August/014222.html[sent in this patch], with Steffan's suggested change, which did exactly what we wanted:

[source,diff]

Add support for dark color scheme in default index & 50x pages

Add a meta tag to index.html & 50x.html to support dark color schemes.
This will display the index page in dark colors if the user has
requested a dark color scheme in their system UI or browser, and
display the same as the previous version if not.

This uses the browsers built-in styles and doesn't hard code any colors or styles.

Then https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2021-August/014223.html[Maxim replied] saying, essentially, "better, but I'd rather use CSS instead of adding a meta tag" - i.e. remove the meta tag and add this CSS: `html { color-scheme: light dark; }`.

Maxim also included _his_ patch which implemented this and asked me to test it.

I https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2021-August/014224.html[tested his patch, which worked great and then made a suggestion about removing the hardcoded fonts too], which was declined, sadly.

== Done & Released

Maxim https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2021-August/014226.html[then committed his final version of the patch]... and that was it!

So, in the end, I didn't _actually_ get any of _my_ code into nginx, but the process was fairly painless, everyone was polite and helpful -- and the nginx welcome & error pages now respect your dark mode preferences. I did at least get my name in the changelog:

Dark mode support in welcome and 50x error pages.

This is what the welcome page code looks like now:

----
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
html { color-scheme: light dark; }
