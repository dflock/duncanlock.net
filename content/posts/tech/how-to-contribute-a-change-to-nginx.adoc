I wanted to add dark mode support to the default nginx "Welcome to nginx" page. This is about the simplest change I could choose to make - it's a simple, backwards compatible, nine line additive change to one single `index.html` file. The change itself looks like this and is added to the files `<style>` element, in the `<head>` section:

[source,css]
----
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: #363839;
    color: #d1cec9;
  }
  a {
    color: #c4c4ff;
  }
}
----

So, this is the process of getting that change from my brain, into the upstream nginx codebase.

== Checking out the Code & Making the Change

The nginx project uses https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/QuickStart[Mercurial], rather than git for source code control. So you will need Mercurial installed for this. This page has https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Download[download links & installation info]. If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, you can just run this to install it:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install mercurial
// Once that's done, you can check it
$ hg --version
Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 5.3.1)
...
----

Once you have Mercurial installed, you can check out the source and make the change like this:

[source,console]
----
// Go to the folder where you want to check out the nginx source
$ cd ~/dev
// Use Mercurial to clone the nginx repo
$ hg clone http://hg.nginx.org/nginx
// Go into the folder
$ cd nginx
// Find the file you need to edit
$ grep -r 'Welcome' .
./docs/html/index.html:<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
./docs/html/index.html:<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
// Make the change
$ $EDITOR ./docs/html/index.html
----

To test this change, you can just open the `~/dev/nginx/docs/html/index.html` in a browser using "File -> Open", as it's just static HTML.

== Contributing the Change Upstream

Nginx development is mailing list based, rather than Github/lab/etc... based. The basic plan is to join the mailing list and send an email to the list, containing a patch with the change.

Follow https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel[the instructions here to join the mailing list]. You will receive a confirmation email. Once you've done that, you can send an email to the list with your change in.

To get your change in a format that's ready to email, I did this:

[source,console]
----
// Commit the change and write a changelog
$ hg commit
// Export the change as a patch, ready to email
$ hg export tip
----

This is the output of that, which I copied & pasted into an email -- and sent it to mailto:nginx-devel@nginx.org[]:

Add support for dark color scheme in default index.html page

Add a little CSS to index.html to support dark color schemes.
This will display the index page in dark colors if the user has
requested a dark color scheme in their system UI or browser, and
display the same as the previous version if not.

See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme

Add support for dark color scheme in default index & 50x pages

Add a meta tag to index.html & 50x.html to support dark color schemes.
This will display the index page in dark colors if the user has
requested a dark color scheme in their system UI or browser, and
display the same as the previous version if not.

This uses the browsers built-in styles and doesn't hard code any colors
or styles.
