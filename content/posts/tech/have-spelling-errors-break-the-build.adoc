In software development, we have a thing called "linters" -- programs that check your code for mistakes. These are usually looking for coding mistakes. There are several ways to run linters:

. You can run them manually at the command line and they'll print out a list of errors & warnings.
. You can have your editor run them whenever you change things and show you a wavy underline for errors & warnings - like spellcheck in a word processor.
. You can have your automated build pipeline run them and stop if there are any errors or warnings.

The first one relies on people doing that chore regularly -- and the second two are automated & reliable, so do those.

Linters are very helpful magic: you should lint everything you can, all the time.

.These two screenshots are https://eslint.org/[eslint] telling me that I've made two mistakes in this line of code: creating a variable but not using it anywhere, and using the wrong kind of quotes.

== Spelling Linters

You can also use linters to check for spelling mistakes - just like a regular spellchecker.

The way text editors show linter errors as a [.wavy-underline]#wavy coloured underline# is copied from the way word processors show spelling errors. It turns out that you can _also_ use linters to check for spelling & grammar errors - in both your code and your writing.

Why is this useful - and why is this better than just using the built-in spellchecking?
