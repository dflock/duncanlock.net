I started trying mindfulness meditation about two months ago. This is what I've learned so far.

I'm just doing basic mindfulness meditation. I used this for about a month: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getsomeheadspace.android[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getsomeheadspace.android] - then tried doing it on my own, and it's working ok so far.
I've also read this, which helped: http://www.amazon.co.uk/10%25-Happier-Reduced-Self-Help-Actually/dp/1444799045[http://www.amazon.co.uk/10%25-Happier-Reduced-Self-Help-Actually/dp/1444799045]
