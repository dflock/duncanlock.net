* A few years ago we moved from the UK to Canada, and sold almost all our stuff.
* This changed our perspective on stuff
* The story of stuff & the huge supply chain tail attached to everything
* The river of stuff, take out - put back
* Think about things in terms of opportunity costs - how much their value will change between
the time you take them out of the river of stuff, until the time you put them back.
