* A few years ago we moved from the UK to Canada, and sold almost all our stuff.
* This changed our perspective on stuff
* The story of stuff & the huge supply chain tail attached to everything
* The river of stuff, take out - put back
* Think about things in terms of opportunity costs - how much their value will change between
the time you take them out of the river of stuff, until the time you put them back.

Ferengi saw the universe as having "millions of worlds, all with too much of one, and not enough of the other," with the Great Continuum flowing through them all like a mighty river, from have to want and back again. As such, it was the force that bound the universe together. To get everything you desire in life, you had to have your ship navigate the Continuum with entrepreneurial skill and grace. In practice, this meant that material taken from one area had to be replaced or paid for through another means, while avoiding obstacles and pitfalls. If one region had a shortage of one type of good, but a surfeit of another, while another region had too much of the former good and a shortage of the latter, then the Great Material Continuum would carry the excess of the one region to ease the dearth in the other.
