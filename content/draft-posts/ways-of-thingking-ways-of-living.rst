Follow the Data, not the Tribe
-------------------------------

People are the opposite of Ants & Bees - we're smart individually, but stupid in groups.

Dig for reality.

What would Happen If Everyone/No One Did That?
-----------------------------------------------

If your actions are scaled up, and everyone started doing them - what happens? Would you want to live in that world? No? Don't do it then.

If your actions were abolished, and no one ever did that - what happens? Would you want to live in that world? Yes? Don't do it then.

What's the Worst that could happen?
