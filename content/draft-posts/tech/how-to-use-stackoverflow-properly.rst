How to find questions you can answer
======================================

Use the http://stackoverflow.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers page, but make sure you add *lots* of Ignored Tags

For some reason, people often answer questions in the comments - this is wrong for lots of reasons:

- It makes the answers hard to find for other people
- It means that an answer can never be accepted, so other people won't be able to tell it has and answer
- I appears in the unanswered lists forver.
- You get no credit for answers supplied in the comments
- Formatting and space is very limited.
- etc....


Reputation Building Tips
==========================

Answers in the comments are just asking for it
--------------------------------------------------

If people are stupid enough to do this, then they deserve to be punished (a little tiny bit). Copy their answer out of the comment into a real answer. Expand on it in the extra space you now have, improve the formattting - and wait for the reputation points to roll in.

Answer questions from experienced users
-------------------------------------------
Everything else being equal, answer questions asked by users with higher reputation. They know how the site works, they know to accept and upvote answers. New users often don't, or they'll ask a question and never some back - so it's much more likely that you'll answer their questions and not get any reward for it.
