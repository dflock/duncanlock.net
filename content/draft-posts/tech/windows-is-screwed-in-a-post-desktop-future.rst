If you're building something that needs an :abbr:`OS (Operating System)` -  a rocket (SpaceX) or a console (Valve) - you HAVE to use Linux, nothing else makes sense. Nothing.

Windows is closed source software - only Microsoft can change the code, you just get to use the end result. You can either like it, or not, but you can't change the way it works.

Because Microsoft has only designed Windows to work on generic PC compatible hardware - desktop and laptop computers - if you need something different to this, your out of luck.

If you're building a product that needs an operating system - which is pretty much anything with electronics in - and you product isn't a generic PC compatible desktop or laptop computer, you can't use Windows as your OS.

What are you going to do - ask Microsoft do you a custom Windows for Rockets? Hey, could we have a good volume deal on a custom Windows for our new XBox competitor? Yeah, sure.

Transition to Multi-screen world
----------------------------------------


The only way MS can compete is to make the Hardware too - hence Surface.

So, they become a crappy version of Apple and their marketshare slowly dwindles to match.


Embedded Windows
