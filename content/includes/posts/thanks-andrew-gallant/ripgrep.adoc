Ripgrep is a _superfast_ replacement for grep, ag, ack etc... It's not just _way_ faster than all of them, it also has full Unicode support and better defaults: recursive, and ignores files in any .gitignore files that it comes across. These are usually what I want, so no aliases, less typing and faster results. It's written in Rust, so just download the single static binary and run it - and, if for some reason you're forced to use it, Ripgrep also works on Windows.
