fd is very fast (parallelized directory traversal), flexible, and intuitive (`fd PATTERN` instead of `find -iname '*PATTERN*'`) utility for searching files and folders. It supports regular expressions or glob-based patterns, color-coded file type highlighting, and smart case-insensitivity. It ignores hidden files and directories and patterns from .gitignore by default - and also supports parallel command execution.

This is what `tldr fd` says:

Recursively find files matching a specific pattern in the current directory::
  `fd "string|regex"`
Find files that begin with `foo`::
  `fd "^foo"`
Find files with a specific extension::
  `fd --extension txt`
Find files in a specific directory::
  `fd "string|regex" path/to/directory`
Include ignored and hidden files in the search::
  `fd --hidden --no-ignore "string|regex"`
Run a command on each search result returned::
  `fd "string|regex" --exec command``
