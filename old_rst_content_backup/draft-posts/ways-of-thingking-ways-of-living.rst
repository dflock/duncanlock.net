Think from First Principles, Deeply
-----------------------------------

Reason from first principles if you want to do something new - don't just iterate on someone else's existing idea.

Have an Action Bias

Don't Get Angry - Get Involved
-------------------------------

Anger without action is just impotent rage - and anger itself is always counterproductive, always the wrong emotion. Unless you're in a physical fight for your life, anger always ends up hurting you.

Follow the Data, not the Tribe
-------------------------------

People are the opposite of Ants & Bees - we're smart individually, but stupid in groups.

Dig for reality.

What would Happen If Everyone/No One Did That?
-----------------------------------------------

If your actions are scaled up, and everyone started doing them - what happens? Would you want to live in that world? No? Don't do it then.

If your actions were abolished, and no one ever did that - what happens? Would you want to live in that world? Yes? Don't do it then.

In the same way that it's not the raindrop which is important but the process of raining -- it's not the individual vote which is important but the process of democracy, and, like rain, you can't have one without the other.

What's the Worst that could happen?

Only care about things that can care back
-------------------------------------------

You family, your friends, your fellow human beings, our fellow inhabitants of this Earth. Not money, things, corporations. They can't care back.

Shoulders Down, Shoulders Back, Chin Level
------------------------------------------

Try it - it's a magic spell for great posture.
