# blueprint

A simple theme for Pelican, with [100% easy to read][1] text as a focus, using Google Web Fonts (Droid Serif, Bitter & PT Sans Mono - and a few characters from Gabriela) and Twitter Bootstrap. It is responsive as supported by Twitter Bootstrap, and a lot of effort has been put into a reading great experience on all devices, including mobile.

This theme is built on top of on existing pelican theme called Built Text.

## Configuration Variables

Social icons come from the [Fontello][3] project - amalgamated from various fonts.

Like built text, this theme supports an optional footer content element under the variable name `COLOPHON` (if set to true). `COLOPHON_TITLE` and `COLOPHON_CONTENT` will help in setting a footer content. A preview is shown below:
