My wife an I live in Canada, and our families are back in the UK. We'd been using Skype to chat with people back in the UK, but I was getting frustrated with Skype's limitations: it ties you to a computer and Wifi, or running a battery hungry app which slows down your phone. It doesn't work very well over the 3G phone network here and while it's free to make Skype to Skype calls, it's fairly expensive calling real phones. I didn't really want to buy a dedicated Skype phone - we both already have mobile phones. And, to top it all off, the Skype software for Linux is the poor cousin of the Windows one, especially if you run 64 bit Linux.

In addition to al these Skype specific issues, our parents both live out in the English countryside, and their internet connections are pretty slow. It would be much more reliable if they didn't have to use the internet on their end.

So, what I really wanted was something that I could easily use on my Android phone without having to run yet another app, and that was cheaper and easier to use. I also wanted something that could be used exactly like a regular local phone number - just call it and ring a phone on the other side of the world.

What I wanted was a Magic Phone Number
======================================

After a lot of reading & research [#parlar]_, I decided that I wanted a :abbr:`VOIP (Voice Over IP)` [#voip_wiki]_ setup of some sort.

Unlike Skype, VOIP is an open standard, which means that anyone can create software and devices for it, not just one company. Amongst other things, this means that there are also lots of VOIP soft-phones [#soft-phone]_ available for every platform and Android has built in support for making and receiving VOIP calls - so it would just work on our phones.

There are also lots of VOIP services available that provide lots of other features, like :abbr:`DID (Direct Inward Dialling - i.e. real phone numbers)`, voice-mail, call forwarding, ring groups, :abbr:`IVR (Interactive Voice Response - i.e. Press One for..., Two for... )` etc...
