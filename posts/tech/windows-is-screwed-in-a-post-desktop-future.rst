	This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

	The legend consists of all elements after the caption.  In this
	case, the legend consists of this paragraph.

If you're building something that needs an OS -  a rocket (spaceX) or a console (valve) - you HAVE to use Linux, nothing else makes sense. Nothing. What are you going to do - ask Microsoft do you a custom Windows for Rockets? Hey, could we have a good volume deal on a custom Windows for our new XBox competitor? Like fuck you are.

The only way MS can compete is to make the Hardware too - hence Surface.

So, they become a crappy version of Apple and their marketshare slowly dwindles to match.
